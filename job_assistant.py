job_assistant.py — Human-sounding job application text generator.

Multi-pass LLM pipeline that produces cover letters, resumes, and Q&A answers
that read like a real person wrote them, not a chatbot.

Usage as a module:
    from job_assistant import generate_cover_letter, generate_resume_json, answer_question

Usage standalone:
    python job_assistant.py cover_letter --resume resume.txt --jd job.txt
    python job_assistant.py answer --resume resume.txt --jd job.txt --question "Why do you want this role?"
    python job_assistant.py resume --resume resume.txt --jd job.txt

# Rules injected into cover letter and Q&A prompts to disrupt AI-typical structure.
STRUCTURAL_RULES = """\
STRUCTURAL RULES — follow these exactly:
- Use contractions everywhere: I'm, I've, I'll, didn't, doesn't, won't, can't, it's.
- Vary sentence length aggressively. Mix very short sentences (under 6 words) with longer ones. Real writing is bursty.
- NEVER write 4 equal-length paragraphs. Break the pattern: a short 1-sentence paragraph is fine. An asymmetric layout is human.
- Embed skills into narrative. Show, don't list. Wrong: "I am proficient in Python, React, and AWS." Right: "I built the ingestion pipeline in Python, then moved the frontend to React when we outgrew jQuery."
- Include at least one specific challenge or tension that was overcome — not everything was perfect.
- Every paragraph must contain at least one specific: a number, a proper noun (company, tool, person, project), or a concrete outcome.
- Do NOT parrot the job description back. Reference it indirectly through your own experience.
- Do NOT praise the company with generic adjectives. If you mention the company, reference something concrete (a product, a blog post, a recent event).
- Do NOT use bullet points unless explicitly asked.
- One em-dash or parenthetical aside is fine. More than two looks AI-generated.
- Do NOT end every sentence on a positive note. Neutral statements are human.
- Avoid tricolon patterns (listing exactly 3 things in a row, e.g. "X, Y, and Z") more than once.\
"""

# Rules for resume generation — ATS-optimized, professional, not conversational.
RESUME_STRUCTURAL_RULES = """\
RESUME WRITING RULES — follow these exactly:
- TAILORED TITLE: Generate a "tailored_title" field that exactly mirrors the target job title from the JD (e.g. "Senior Java Backend Engineer"). This appears under the candidate's name on the resume and must match ATS search terms for the role.
- SPELLING AND GRAMMAR: Every sentence must be grammatically complete and flawless. No fragments, no typos, no misplaced commas. Proofread every bullet before including it.
- HARD SKILLS: The skills section must list every hard skill explicitly mentioned or implied by the JD that the candidate possesses. Group into distinct categories — do not lump everything into one list. ATS scanners check for exact keyword matches.
- Summary: 2-3 sentences, professional tone, NO contractions, NO first-person pronouns ("I", "my", "me"). Write as a noun phrase or role descriptor (e.g. "Senior backend engineer with 10+ years..."). ATS-friendly — include key terms from the JD naturally.
- Experience bullets: Start each with a strong, varied action verb. Rotate from: Built, Designed, Migrated, Reduced, Automated, Led, Implemented, Deployed, Refactored, Scaled, Integrated, Introduced, Established, Cut, Shipped. Never start two consecutive bullets with the same verb.
- NO contractions. NO first-person "I". Resumes use implied first person (verb-first bullets).
- Quantify every achievement where data exists: percentages, time saved, user counts, team sizes, request volumes.
- DYNAMIC BULLET COUNT based on tenure at each role. Use today's date to calculate duration for any role marked "Present". Target bullet counts: under 12 months -> 2-3 bullets; 1-2 years -> 3-4 bullets; 2-4 years -> 4-6 bullets; 4+ years -> 6-8 bullets. Do NOT assign the same bullet count to all roles.
- Mix bullet formats for variety: some lead with the tool/tech ("Kafka-based event pipeline..."), some with the outcome ("Cut API latency 35% by..."), some with context ("As the team scaled past 100K users...").
- Each experience bullet must embed at least one hard skill keyword from the JD. Do not silo skills only in the skills section.
- Every bullet must earn its place — no filler. If a bullet doesn't contain a specific technology, outcome, or scale metric, cut it.
- Avoid: "responsible for", "helped with", "worked on", "assisted in". Replace with active verbs and outcomes.\
